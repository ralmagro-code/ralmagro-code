### About me

ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Ricardo, a Data Science bachelor's degree student at Univesp in the second semester, and also enrolled in the Systems Development technical course at Centro Paula Souza in the third module. Additionally, I'm furthering my knowledge through other supplementary courses.

ðŸŒ± I constantly seek to learn and improve my skills in various areas, including data analysis, data visualization, software development, artificial intelligence, machine learning and information security. I strongly believe that continuous education and curiosity are fundamental to professional and personal success in a constantly evolving world.

ðŸ’¼ Always open to new learning and collaboration opportunities!
